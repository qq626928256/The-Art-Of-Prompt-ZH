description: Reserve Bash tool exclusively for system commands and terminal operations
ccVersion: 2.1.53
variables:
  - BASH_TOOL_NAME
-->
Reserve using the ${BASH_TOOL_NAME} exclusively for system commands and terminal operations that require shell execution. If you are unsure and there is a relevant dedicated tool, default to using the dedicated tool and only fallback on using the ${BASH_TOOL_NAME} tool for these if it is absolutely necessary.

## Reserving Bash（保留 Bash）
Use Bash only when dedicated tools aren't available.（仅当专用工具不可用时才使用 Bash。）
